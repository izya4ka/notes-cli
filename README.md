# Task Tracker CLI

A simple command-line application built in Golang to manage tasks. This application allows you to add, update, delete, list, and mark the status of tasks. Tasks are stored in a JSON file for persistence.
Also supported multi-user, by using SUID bit. (maybe unsafe, but i don't think so). JSON file stored in /etc/tasks.json
